# PROBLEM

The dynamics of the cart-pole system shown in Figure  is given below. Here M and m<sub>p</sub> is the mass (kg) of the cart and pole respectively. The linear displacement (in m) of the cart is s denoted by x, g is the acceleration due to gravity, θ is the angular displacement (radians) of the pole of length L (in m) and F<sub>x</sub> is the input force applied to the cart (in N). Find the optimal control input (F<sub>x</sub>) that takes the pole from the initial angular position θ(0) = π/6 to the desired angular position θ(t<sub>f</sub>) = 0? (Here, the final time tf is a free variable.) M = 20 Kg, m<sub>p</sub> = 0.5 kg, L = 0.5 m;</br>
